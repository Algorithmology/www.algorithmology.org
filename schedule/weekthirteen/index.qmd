## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 15 in [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Explore hash table implementations
in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you conduct an experiment to evaluate different approaches to mapping? Which
approach has the best object-oriented design?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Review previous chapters to
contextualize how the data structures like `ListMapping` use the `list` data
structure.

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Hierarchical Data Structures
  - Explore how to implement the `Tree` data structure
  - Learn how to calculate characteristics of a tree like height and depth
  - Learn how to traverse a tree in different ways like pre-order and post-order 
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Continue
algorithm engineering project
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Report on results
from algorithm all-hands project

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `lcsfinder`, that runs benchmarks to
study the performance of finding the longest common sub-sequence of data values

### Steps

- Use `lcsfinder` as your template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `lcsfinder`
  - **Week 2**: Design and conduct experiments and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
