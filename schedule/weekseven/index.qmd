## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapters 6 and 7 in A
First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Try out the implementations of
`Stack`, `Queue`, and `Deque` in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you write your own tests cases for these abstract data types? Can you use these
abstract data types in your own program?
- Note that, along with chapter 8, chapter 7 will again be the focus for next week

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Stacks, Queues, and Deques
  - Explore the concept of an abstract data type (ADT)
  - Understand implementation trade-offs for stacks, queues, and deques
  - Use asymptotic analysis to characterize performance of an ADT
  - Enhance an ADT implementation with useful exception handling
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Continue algorithm engineering project
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Start new algorithm all-hands project

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `filesorting`, that runs
benchmarks to study the performance of sorting different types of data.

### Steps

- Use `filesorting` as your template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `filesorting`
  - **Week 2**: Design and conduct experiments and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
