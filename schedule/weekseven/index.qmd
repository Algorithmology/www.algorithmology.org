## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapters 6 and 7 in [A
First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Try out the implementations of
`Stack`, `Queue`, and `Deque` in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you write your own tests cases for these data structures? Can you use these
data structures in your own program?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Note that, along with chapter 8,
chapter 7 will again be the focus for next week

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday and Thursday**:
Stacks, Queues, and Deques
  - Explore the concept of an abstract data type (ADT)
  - Understand implementation trade-offs for stacks, queues, and deques
  - Use asymptotic analysis to characterize performance of an ADT
  - Enhance an ADT implementation with useful exception handling
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Continue
algorithm engineering project four (see the [prior week](../weeksix/) for
details about this project) and take mid-term examination one
