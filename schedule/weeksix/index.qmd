## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 5 of [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Experimentally evaluate
performance of algorithms, data structures, and systems in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/)
- Note that next week we will cover a new chapter of the book!

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Analytical Evaluation
  - Further understand why program performance is critically important
  - Characterize performance patterns in Python programs
  - Use asymptotic analysis to characterize performance
  - Examine source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Start new algorithm engineering project
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Start new algorithm all-hands project

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `filesorting`, that runs
benchmarks to study the performance of sorting different types of data.

### Steps

- Use `filesorting` as your template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `filesorting`
  - **Week 2**: Design and conduct experiments and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
