## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 5 of [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Experimentally evaluate
performance of algorithms, data structures, and systems in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Note that next week we will cover a new chapter of the book!

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday and Thursday**:
Analytical Evaluation
  - Further understand why program performance is critically important
  - Characterize performance patterns in Python programs
  - Use asymptotic analysis to characterize performance
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Submit
algorithm engineering project three, start algorithm engineering project four,
and give presentations for the first algorithm all-hands session

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `filesorter`, that runs benchmarks to
study the performance of sorting different types of data stored in a CSV file.

### Steps

- Click the link provided in Discord to get started on this project
- Use {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} [File
Sorting](https://github.com/Algorithmology/file-sorting-starter) as your
template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv` and/or `poetry`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `filesorter`
  - **Week 2**: Design and conduct experiments and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
