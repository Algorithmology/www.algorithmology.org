## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapters 20 and 21 in [A
First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Explore directed and un-directed
graph implementations in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/).
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Review previous chapters to see how
the data structures like `List` and `Tree` support the behavior of this data
structure.

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday**: Graph Structures
  - Explore how to implement the `Graph` and `Digraph` data structures
  - Understand the adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Presentations
for the third algorithm all-hands project
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Continue
algorithm engineering project seven (see the [prior week](../weekfourteen/)
for details about this project) and take algorithm engineering skill-check four
