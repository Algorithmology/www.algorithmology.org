## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapters 9 and 10 in [A
First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Explore algorithms that use recursion and dynamic
programming in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you add debugging statements to trace how these algorithms work?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Read chapter 9 for a review of
recursion and how it works in the Python language
- {{< iconify fa6-solid robot size=18px >}} Design, implement, and test your own
efficient implementation of the `lcs` function! How would you measure this
function's performance?

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday and Thursday**:
Dynamic Programming
  - Explore how to implement recursive functions in Python
  - Investigate a new algorithmic paradigm called dynamic programming
  - Learn more about the longest common sub-sequence problem
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Continue
algorithm engineering project five (see the [prior week](../weeknine/) for
details about this project) and take algorithm engineering skill-check three
