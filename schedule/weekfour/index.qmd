## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 4 of [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Study `test` for the `ds2` package
of [donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/)

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday and Thursday**:
Software Testing
  - Understand why algorithm engineers must test Python programs
  - Explore the benefits and limitations of testing
  - Investigate different approaches to software testing
  - Examine source code segments to illustrate trade-offs
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Submit
algorithm engineering project two, start algorithm engineering project three,
and take the first algorithm engineering skill-check in the second half of the
laboratory session

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `objectprocessing`, that runs
benchmarks to study the performance of storing and searching for objects using
three different ways for determining whether or not a search term matches the
value in an object's attributes.

### Steps

- Click the link provided in Discord to get started on this project
- Use {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} [Object
Processing](https://github.com/Algorithmology/object-processing-starter) as your
template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv` and/or `poetry`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `objectprocessing`
  - **Week 2**: Design, conduct, and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions

Students who completed this project shared these insights:

- "Object processing can be a challenging task! But it is useful when
determining overheads for how fast a different search approaches are going to be
in Python. It allows us to manipulate different variables of the approach to
determine the fastest way to search through a database." **Keller Liptrap**

- "This experiment taught me how to properly organize and search through large
data files using an object-oriented approach. This project taught me how
efficient these systems can be when handling larger data sets." **Sabrina
Rodriguez**
