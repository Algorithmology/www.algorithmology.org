## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapters 7 and 8 in [A
First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Try out the implementations of
`OrderedList` in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you write your own tests cases for these abstract data types? Can you use these
abstract data types in your own program?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Note that chapter 7 was also the
focus of last week
- {{< iconify fa6-solid robot size=18px >}} Design, implement, and test your own
efficient implementation of the `Deque` using the `DoubleLinkedList`!

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists
  - Deepen understanding of an abstract data type (ADT)
  - Understand implementation trade-offs for list-based structures
  - Use asymptotic analysis to characterize performance of an ADT
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Mid-term executable examination
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Algorithm
analysis from mid-term examination

## Project

### Goal

Complete an executable examination for the mid-term assessment that covers the
content in Chapters one through five of [A First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/). In the algorithm all-hands
session following the examination, you will receive an additional assignment
that invites you to write a retrospective in which you assess the design,
implementation, and performance of one of the Python functions that you
implemented as part of the examination.
