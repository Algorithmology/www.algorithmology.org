## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 19 in [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Explore `PriorityQueue`
implementations in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you write tests to confirm that they preserve priority? Can you see how this
data structure combines those that we previously studied?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Review previous chapters to see how
the data structures like `List`, `Queue`, and `Tree` support the behavior of
this data structure.

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Priority Queues
  - Explore how to implement the `PriorityQueue` data structure
  - Understand how the `List` and `Tree` support implementing the `PriorityQueue`
  - Explore how the `Heap` can be used to implement the `PriorityQueue`
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Start a new 
algorithm engineering project
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Begin a new algorithm all-hands project

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `treesearcher`, that runs benchmarks to
study the performance of finding data values in a hierarchical data structure.

### Steps

- Use `treesearcher` as your template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `treesearcher`
  - **Week 2**: Design and conduct experiments and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
