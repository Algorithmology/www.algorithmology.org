## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 5 of [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Experimentally evaluate
performance of algorithms, data structures, and systems in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Note that next week's focus will be
on running time analysis, which is a related concept in algorithm analysis!

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday and Thursday**:
Empirical Evaluation
  - Understand why program performance is critically important
  - Characterize performance patterns in Python programs
  - Use experimentation to characterize performance trade-offs
  - Prepare for using asymptotic analysis to characterize performance
  - Examine source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Continue
algorithm engineering project three (see the [prior week](../weekfour/) for
details about this project)
