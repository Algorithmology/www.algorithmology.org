## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 5 of [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Experimentally evaluate
performance of algorithms, data structures, and systems in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/)

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Empirical Evaluation
  - Understand why algorithm engineers must test Python programs
  - Explore the benefits and limitations of testing
  - Investigate different approaches to testing
  - Examine source code segments to illustrate trade-offs
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Start new algorithm engineering project
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Algorithm all-hands session

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `objectprocessing`, that runs
benchmarks to study the performance of storing and searching for objects using
three different ways for determining whether or not a search term matches the
value in an object's attributes.

### Steps

- Use [Object Processing](https://github.com/Algorithmology/object-processing-starter) as your template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `objectprocessing`
  - **Week 2**: Design, conduct, and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
