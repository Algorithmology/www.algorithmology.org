## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapters 11 through 14 in
[A First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Explore algorithms that perform
searching and sorting in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you add debugging statements to trace how these algorithms work? Can you prove
the worst-case time complexity of these algorithms?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Review chapters to confirm that you
understand the worst-case time complexities

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Monday and Wednesday**:
Searching and Sorting
  - Explore how to implement searching and sorting algorithms Python
  - Apply a new algorithmic paradigm called dynamic programming
  - Learn more about `mergesort` and `quickselect` algorithms
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Thursday**: Start new algorithm engineering project
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Friday**: Start new algorithm all-hands project

## Project

### Goal

To build and use a Python program, called `lcsfinder`, that runs benchmarks to
study the performance of finding the longest common sub-sequence of data values

### Steps

- Use `lcsfinder` as your template repository
- Install the project's dependencies using `devenv`
- Follow the instructions to complete the project:
  - **Week 1**: Implement all of the modules in `listconcatenator`
  - **Week 2**: Design and conduct experiments and document experimental results
- Schedule [office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) if you
have questions
