## Exploration

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open size=18px >}} Read chapter 15 in [A First
Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/)
- {{< iconify fa6-brands github size=18px >}} Explore hash table implementations
in the `ds2` package of
[donsheehy/datastructures](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures/). Can
you conduct an experiment to evaluate different approaches to mapping? Which
approach has the best object-oriented design?
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book size=18px >}} Review previous chapters to
contextualize how the data structures like `ListMapping` use the `list` data
structure.

## Activities

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line size=18px >}} **Tuesday and Thursday**: Hash
Tables
  - Explore how to implement hashing functions that map numbers to list indices
  - Investigate trade-offs with bucket size, hashing function, and re-hashing
  - Examine Python source code segments to illustrate key points
- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Continue
algorithm engineering project six (see the [prior week](../weekeleven/) for
details about this project) and take mid-term examination two
