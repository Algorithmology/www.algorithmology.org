      - Algorithm all-hands project
    - Prepare for these assessments:
      - Midterm examination
      - Final examination
      - Skill-checks
- {{< iconify game-icons team-idea size=18px >}} **Thursday and Friday**:
Algorithm All-Hands Projects
    - **Cadence**: Two weeks devoted to **phase one**, two weeks for **phase
    two**, and finally one week for **phase three**. Complete these tasks during
    the second halves of Thursday's classroom session and Friday's laboratory
    session.
    - {{< iconify fa6-solid users-gear size=18px >}} **Phase One**: Building on
    prior scientific and engineering content, prepare a research question and
    design an experiment to answer it
        - **Goal**: *Scientific study in algorithmology*
          - Propose research question connect to current module
          - Specify evaluation metrics used to answer research question
          - Design an experiment to measure evaluation metrics
          - Assign tasks for the remaining phases of the project
    - {{< iconify fa6-solid users-gear size=18px >}} **Phase Two**: Leveraging
    prior work, implement all needed software tools and apply them when
    conducting the experiment designed in the prior phase
        - **Goal**: *Engineering effort in algorithmology*
          - Identify useful function(s) for refinement
          - Explain steps for improving the function(s)
          - Create a pull request and follow it through review
          - Give an overview of the completed function(s)
          - Give a demonstration of a command-line tool using the function(s)
    - {{< iconify fa6-solid users-gear size=18px >}} **Phase Three**: Leveraging
    prior work, release useful function(s)
        - **Goal**: *Effective communication in algorithmology*
          - Analyze and interpret the results
          - Create a web-based report to present and discuss the results
          - Collaboratively publish the report to the course web site
          - Present the report and participate in a discussion session
          - Provide thorough answer(s) to the chosen research question

- {{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project size=18px >}} **Friday**: Algorithm Engineering Project
  - **Week One**: Design, implement, test, document, and maintain
      - Data structure(s) and algorithm(s)
      - Benchmark evaluation framework
      - Data analysis and visualization tools
  - **Week Two**: Design and conduct an experiment
    - Demonstrate implementation of completed system
    - Document the experimental design
    - Pose research question(s)
