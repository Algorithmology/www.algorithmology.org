## Welcome to an Adventure in Algorithm Analysis!

In addition to ensuring that the programs they implement are correct and
maintainable, an algorithm engineer must confirm that their code is efficient.
The focus of this course --- called "algorithmology" for fun! --- is the study
of algorithms, with a concentration on both their correctness and efficiency.
Algorithmology requires the completion of tasks that leverage knowledge and
skills in both engineering and science. For instance, an algorithm engineer
needs to design, implement, and test data structures and algorithms and then
correctly integrate them into a working software system. However, an algorithm
engineer must also use the scientific method to analyze the efficiency of both
a software system's components and the system as a whole. This course introduces
learners to both empirical and analytical approaches to studying the efficiency
of algorithms, data structures, and the software systems that contain them.

## Schedule

With the goal of enabling effective developer development, this web site
features a sixteen-week schedule filled with activities that support the
development of your professional and technical capacities in the field of
algorithm analysis. Although this site is best used by an on-campus learner in
the [Department of Computer and information
Science](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/) at [Allegheny
College](https://www.allegheny.edu/), the resources and projects are all
publicly available. For instance, the following provides a list of the three
textbooks that developing developers use to hone their professional and
technical skills during sixteen weeks of personal growth:

## Adventure

Interested in getting started on a developer development adventure? Begin here:

- The [sixteen-week course schedule](./schedule/index.qmd) offers detailed
insights into each step that learners should take to help them to develop as
developers, including a list of reading assignment and descriptions of various
projects.

- The [course syllabus](./syllabus/index.qmd) introduces the course and its
learning objectives and explains how on-campus learners will be assessed by the
course instructor.

- The [developer development blog](./syllabus/index.qmd) includes executive
summaries of all of the key professional and technical insights that students
learned when actively engaging with the content in **SE**, **FB**, and **DB**.
The blog also contains reports from the design, implementation, testing,
documentation, and deployment of two software projects. Read more to watch us
develop as developers!

Interested in connecting with other like-minded algorithm engineers? Please join
the [Algorithmology Discord Server](https://discord.gg/phSQfB8bZx) and join the
conversation! If you are an on-campus learning at Allegheny College, you may
also join the [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6). Finally, if you are an on-campus
learner, then you may schedule a meeting with the course instructor during
office hours by visiting the [Course Instructor's Appointment
Scheduler](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).
