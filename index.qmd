## Introduction

Regardless of the role or the company or the project in which they find
themselves, a software engineer is always a *developing developer*. Like the
word "developer" in the above logo, developers always have a "missing piece" of
the "D" in their developer skills. Put in another way, all developers have a
professional skill that they have not yet honed, new technologies that they
have yet to explore, program features that they have not yet implemented, or
[slides](slides/index.qmd) nefarious bugs that they have not yet
found and fixed! Always working to establish a confidence in their program's
correctness, a developing developer aims to engineer and ship high-quality
software that is designed, documented, tested, and maintained according to
industry best practices. `code sample`
