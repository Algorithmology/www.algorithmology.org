# What is a priority queue? Why is it useful?

::: incremental

- Normally data items removed based on insertion order
- Now, data items are removed based on priority!
- Queue that supports priority-oriented data access
- Aim to have good performance for all key operations

{{< iconify game-icons team-idea >}} **Any examples of data we should store in a priority queue?**

:::

## Main methods in a `PriorityQueue` API

::: {.fragment .fade-up .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0em; font-size: 0.80em;"}

- `insert(item, priority)`: Add `item` with the given `priority`.

- `findmin()` - Return the item with the minimum priority. If there are
multiple items with the minimum priority, ties may be broken arbitrarily.

- `removemin()` - Remove and return the item with the minimum priority. As with
the `findmin` method, ties are broken arbitrarily.

:::

::: incremental

- Use a list-based approach for a starting implementation
- Identify performance trade-offs when using a list
- Develop a new data structure called a `heap`
- Use the `heap` to support efficient priority queue operations
