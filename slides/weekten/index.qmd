# Recursion means a "reference to self"!

- Implementation of recursion in Python language
- Mental model for how to think about recursive functions
- Use of recursion as a problem solving technique
- Analysis of the running time of recursive functions

## Recursive implementation of `sumk`

```{python}
def sumk(k):
    if k > 0:
        return sumk(k-1) + k
    return 0

print(sumk(1))
print(sumk(2))
print(sumk(3))
print(sumk(4))
print(sumk(5))
```
