- **Sequence**: Run operations one after another in an order
- **Selection**: Decide which operations will execute
- **Iteration**: Repeat an operation a specific number of times
:::

## Sequence: Run operations one after another in a specified order

```python
def detect() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Run all of the sub-detects."""
    run_output: List[Dict[str, str]] = []
    run_output = execute.execute_by_name_filter(
        constants.project.Detect_Module, constants.project.Detect_Filter
    )
    return util.union_list_of_dicts(run_output)
```

- Calling the `detect` function causes each line to run sequentially

- Invoke `execute_by_name_filter` function with two inputs

- Invoke the `union_list_of_dicts` function with one input

- Return output of `union_list_of_dicts` function to caller
