# What are the key features of the Python programming language?

# Thinking and Writing About Python Programs

::: incremental
- **Sequence**: Run operations one after another in an order
- **Selection**: Decide which operations will execute
- **Iteration**: Repeat an operation a specific number of times
:::

## Sequence: Run operations one after another in a specified order

```python
def detect() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Run all of the sub-detects."""
    run_output: List[Dict[str, str]] = []
    run_output = execute.execute_by_name_filter(
        constants.project.Detect_Module, constants.project.Detect_Filter
    )
    return util.union_list_of_dicts(run_output)
```

- Calling the `detect` function causes each line to run sequentially

- Invoke `execute_by_name_filter` function with two inputs

- Invoke the `union_list_of_dicts` function with one input

- Return output of `union_list_of_dicts` function to caller

# Collections contain multiple values

::: incremental
- Strings: `str` in Python
- Lists: `list` in Python
- Tuples: `tuple` in Python
- Dictionaries: `dict` in Python
- Sets: `set` in Python

Let's explore each of these in greater detail!
:::

## Creating and using a string collection

```{python}
s = "Hello, "
t = "World."
u = s + t
print(type(u))
print(u)
print(u[9])
n = str(9876)
print(n[2])
```

::: incremental
::: {style="margin-top: -0.1em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- What is the purpose of the `type` function?
- What is the purpose of the `u[9]` notation?
- What is the purpose of the `str` function?
