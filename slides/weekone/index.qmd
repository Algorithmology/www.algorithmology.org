# What is algorithm analysis?

::: incremental
- Data structures that organize data
- Algorithms that process data structures
- Experimental and theoretical analysis
- "Algorithmology" is both *science* and *engineering*
:::

## Algorithm analysis process

::: incremental
- Design, implement, and test
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Benchmark framework
  - Data analysis tools
- Create execution environments
  - Repeatable and reproducible
  - Controlled and varied
  - Local and in the cloud
:::

# How Can We Characterize the Execution Environment of a Program?

- *Sensing* properties of a system with Python
- *Characterizing* system performance with micro-benchmarks
