# Software programs must work correctly

::: incremental

- **Data structures**: does each structure store data correctly?
- **Algorithm**: does each algorithm produce the correct output?
- **Benchmarks**: is software under study invoked correctly?
- **Data Storage**: do the benchmarks store data correctly?
- **Data Analysis**: does the software analyze data correctly?

:::

## By running a program and checking its output software testing establishes a confidence in its correctness

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- Steps during software testing:
    - Create an input for the program
    - Setup the program's environment
    - Pass the input to the program
    - Collect the output from the program
    - Compare the output to the expected output

:::

## How would you test the `Doubler`?

```{python}
class Doubler:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self._n = 2 * n

    def n(self):
        return self._n

x = Doubler(5)
print(x.n() == 10)
assert(x.n() == 10)
y = Doubler(-4)
print(y.n() == -8)
assert(y.n() == -8)
```

::: {.fragment .fade-left style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- Establishes a confidence in the correctness of the `Doubler` class
- When testing is it better to use `print` or `assert` statements?

:::

## Best practices for software testing

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- Answer the following questions when testing:
    - Does the program meet its specification?
    - After changing the program, does it still work correctly?
- Using assertion statements:
    - `print` statements require manual checking of output
    - `assert` statements automatically checks correctness
- Use a testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest`
- Assess the adequacy of the test suite with `coverage.py`

:::

## `unittest` for `DayOfTheWeek`

```{python}
import unittest
from dayoftheweek import DayOfTheWeek

class TestDayOfTheWeek(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_init(self):
        d = DayOfTheWeek('F')
        self.assertEqual(d.name(), 'Friday')
        d = DayOfTheWeek('Th')
        self.assertEqual(d.name(), 'Thursday')

unittest.main(argv=['ignored'], verbosity=2, exit=False)
```

::: {.fragment .fade-left style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 1.0em;"}

- Call `unittest.main` differently for tests outside Quarto
- Run `test_dayoftheweek.py` in `slides/weekfour/`
- The `OK` output confirms that the assertions passed

:::

## Explore `DayOfTheWeek`

```python
class DayOfTheWeek:
    """A class to represent a day of the week."""
    def __init__(self, abbreviation):
        """Create a new DayOfTheWeek object."""
        self.abbreviation = abbreviation
        self.name_map = {
            "M": "Monday",
            "T": "Tuesday",
            "W": "Wednesday",
            "Th": "Thursday",
            "F": "Friday",
            "Sa": "Saturday",
            "Su": "Sunday",
        }

    def name(self):
        return self.name_map.get(self.abbreviation)
```

::: {.fragment .fade-right style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- Support the lookup of a day of the week through an abbreviation

# Exploring test-driven development in Python

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Questions

- Test-driven development asks you to write tests before code:
    - How will you use a function?
    - What are its inputs and outputs?
    - Can you write code to make tests pass?

## Practices

- The TDD mantra is **Red-Green-Refactor**:
    - **Red**: The tests fail. You havenâ€™t written the code yet!
    - **Green**: You get the tests to pass by changing the code.
    - **Refactor**: You clean up the code, removing duplication.

:::

## How can you refactor Python code?

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Start

```{python}
L1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
avg1 = sum(L1)/len(L1)
avg2 = sum(L2)/len(L2)
print("avg(", L1, ") -->", avg1)
print("avg(", L2, ") -->", avg2)
```

- This code will not work for empty lists!
- *And*, the code is repetitive and hard to read
- Can we refactor the program to avoid the defect?

## Intermediate

```{python}
L1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
if len(L1) == 0:
    avg1 = 0
else:
    avg1 = sum(L1) / len(L1)
if len(L2) == 0:
    avg2 = 0
else:
    avg2 = sum(L2) / len(L2)
print("avg(", L1, ") -->", avg1)
print("avg(", L2, ") -->", avg2)
```

::: {.fragment .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- This avoids the defect but is repetitive and hard to read!

:::


## Finished

```{python}
def avg(L):
    if len(L) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum(L) / len(L)

L1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
avg1 = avg(L1)
avg2 = avg(L2)
print("avg(", L1, ") -->", avg1)
print("avg(", L2, ") -->", avg2)
```

::: {.fragment .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- The `avg` function avoids the defect and is easier to read!

:::

:::

## What should we test?

::: {.fragment .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- For each function, ask yourselves the following questions:
    - What should happen when I run this function?
    - How do I want to use this function?
    - What are the inputs and outputs of this function?
    - What should be the function's inputs and outputs?
    - What are the edge cases for this function?
- Test the system's expected behavior, not its implementation
- Test the public interface of the program under test
- Transform detected defects into repeatable test cases
- Assess the adequacy of the test suite with `coverage.py`

:::

## Testing often positively influences a program's object-oriented design

::: {.fragment .fade style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.95em;"}

- Software testing helps to refine an object-oriented design

- Interplay between testing and object-oriented design:

    - Identify nouns (classes) and verbs (methods)
    - Specify what should happen when you call a method
    - Write a unit test case to encode this expected behavior
    - Confirm that all of the test cases pass
    - Refactor the code to improve its object-oriented design
    - Repeatedly execute the test suite to confirm correctness
