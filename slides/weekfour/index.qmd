# Software programs must work correctly

::: incremental
- **Data structures**: does each structure store data correctly?
- **Algorithm**: does each algorithm produce the correct output?
- **Benchmarks**: is software under study invoked correctly?
- **Data Storage**: do the benchmarks store data correctly?
- **Data Analysis**: does the software analyze data correctly?

## By running a program and checking its output software testing establishes a confidence in its correctness

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- Steps during software testing:
    - Create an input for the program
    - Setup the program's environment
    - Pass the input to the program
    - Collect the output from the program
    - Compare the output to the expected output

## What are the performance trade-offs associated with using objects?

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- Questions to consider when designing an experiment:
  - Cost of calling a method or a function?
  - Cost of accessing an object's attribute?
  - How quickly can your program process data?
  - What is the space overhead of using objects?
- What data structures are best for your application?
- How do data structures influence algorithm performance?
