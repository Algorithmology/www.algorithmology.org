# What are the main goals of object-oriented programming?

::: incremental
- Write code that reflects thought and the world
- Enable code reuse and sharing among programmers
- Encourage the creation of well-designed software
- Ensure that software is easy to maintain and extend
:::

## Type Inference in Python

```{python}
mylist = []
print(type(mylist))
print(isinstance(mylist, list))
print(isinstance(mylist, str))
```

::: {.fragment .fade style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 1em;"}

- `mylist = []` creates an empty list
- `type(mylist)` returns the type of the list
- `isinstance(mylist, list)` checks if `mylist` is a list
- Same approach works for other data types!

:::

## Existing Types Available in Python

```{python}
def example_function():
  return 0
print(type(example_function))
```

<p class="codespacer">

```{python}
def generator_example(n):
  for i in range(n):
    yield i
print(type(generator_example))
print(type(generator_example(5)))
```

::: {.fragment .fade style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- Functions and generators have their own types
- What are the similarities and differences for these two types?

:::


## What if we don't create objects?

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- Questions to consider when designing an experiment:
  - Type of the collection?
  - Contents of the collection?
  - Size of the collection?
  - How often will the collection change?
  - How can we measure time and space overhead?
