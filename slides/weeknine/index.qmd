# What is a linked list?

- Stores a sequential collection of elements
- Uses individual nodes to store data values
- Each node has a reference to the next node
- The first node is called the **head** and the last is the **tail**

```{python}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, data, link = None):
        self.data = data
        self.link = link
```
