# Overview

An analysis of the running time and run time of the assorted `reverse_count`
functions implemented by team members.

# Code 

# TODO: Modify this to include your code in place of mine - I'll clean up merge conflicts later.

```{python}
# Benedek's implementation of the function reverse_count

def reverse_str(data: str) -> str:
    """Reverse the content of the provided string."""
    # I am just using the simple reverse string method.
    return data[::-1]

def reverse_count(data: str) -> dict:
    """Reverse the content of the provided string and return it in a mapping."""
    return {data: {"count": str(len(data)), "reversed": data[::-1]}}
```

```{python}
import timeit
import functools

# Rough draft of potential analysis script.
performance_list = []
for i in timeit.repeat(
  stmt=functools.partial(reverse_count, "checking!"),
    number=10,
  ):
    performance_list.append(i)
print(
  f"Performance time in seconds:\n {performance_list}"
)
```

# Data

# TODO: Include the output of running the two code blocks here, with any analysis you would like to provide
