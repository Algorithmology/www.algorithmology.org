## Luke's Implementation 

The len() function and the str slicing both have a worst case time complexity of O(n) so that would make the total worst case time complexity of the function be O(n). This means that the function grows at a linear rate based on the size of the input and the time it takes to execute the function.

```{python}
def reverse_count(data: str) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Reverse the content of the provided string and return it in a mapping."""
    count = str(len(data))
    reversed_data = str(data[::-1])
    result = {data: {"count": count, "reversed": reversed_data}}
    return result
```
