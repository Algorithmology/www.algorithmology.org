# Overview

An analysis of the running time and run time of the assorted `reverse_count`
functions implemented by team members.


# Code

```python
import timeit
import functools
import typer

from typing import List
from rich.console import Console

cli = typer.Typer()
console = Console()

@cli.command()
def time_analyzer(
  function_to_call: str = typer.Option(...),
  function_input: List[str] = typer.Option(...),
  function_setup: str = typer.Option(...)
):
  """Rough draft of potential analysis script."""
  performance_list = []
  for i in timeit.repeat(
              stmt=functools.partial(function_to_call, function_input),
                number=10,
            ):
                performance_list.append(i)
  console.print(
      f"Performance time in seconds:\n {performance_list}"
  )
```

# Instructions

With that said, you are expected to collaboratively build your team's
benchmarking framework that will correctly collect performance results about
the function that each team member implemented. Again, all team members are
expected to contribute to their team's software for running a performance
benchmark to calculate runtimes! Then, you will each independently run the
benchmarking framework so that you can report results about the performance of
the aforementioned functions.

Each team member must also independently perform a running time analysis of
their own functions and report the results of their work in the form of a proof
sketch and then the worst-case time complexity of the function that they
implemented. Each team member should then reflect on whether or not their
runtime analysis aligns with their running time analysis.

Finally, your team will work together to see who implemented the fastest
function, publish your results to the course web site, and present your results
during the class session next week!
