# Introduction

In modern data processing, efficient sorting is foundational to everything from database operations to machine learning pipelines. While most algorithms excel with unique keys, real-world datasets frequently contain duplicate entries in primary attributes like `name` or `country`. These duplicates usually require algorithms to resolve ties through sequential comparisons of secondary attributes (e.g., `phone_number`, `email`) or an attribute chosen by a user that can be deemed as an `tie-breaker` attribute.

## Motivation

Duplicate entries in primary sorting attributes (e.g., `name`, `country`) are common and when these duplicates occur, sorting algorithms must resolve ties using secondary attributes or attributes inputted by the user that can be considered a 'secondary' attribute, creating a need for efficient **multi-level comparison strategies**. This study analyzes how duplicate rates impact three sorting algorithms (`Bubble Sort`, `QuickSort`, and `Timsort`) when handling multi-level comparisons, providing insights into algorithm selection for real-world data processing.

# Method

## Approach

At the core of our analysis is multi-level sorting logic. We implemented three sorting paradigms with configurable attribute prioritization:

### Bubble Sort

```python
def sort_persons_bubblesort_multilevel(
    persons: List[Person], attribute: str
) -> List[Person]:

    # define the tie-breaking attributes (e.g., secondary and tertiary attributes)
    tie_breaking_attributes = ["name", "country", "phone_number", "job", "email"]

    length_of_persons = len(persons)
    for i in range(length_of_persons):
        for j in range(0, length_of_persons - i - 1):
            # compare records based on the primary attribute
            value1 = getattr(persons[j], attribute)
            value2 = getattr(persons[j + 1], attribute)

            if value1 == value2:
                # if the values are equal, use tie-breaking attributes
                swap = False
                for tie_attr in tie_breaking_attributes:
                    tie_value1 = getattr(persons[j], tie_attr)
                    tie_value2 = getattr(persons[j + 1], tie_attr)
                    if tie_value1 > tie_value2:
                        swap = True
                        break
                    elif tie_value1 < tie_value2:
                        break
            else:
                # if values are not equal, determine if a swap is needed
                swap = value1 > value2

            # swap if necessary
            if swap:
                persons[j], persons[j + 1] = persons[j + 1], persons[j]
    return persons
```

This `bubblesort_multilevel` algorithm implementation extends the classic algorithm by introducing hierarchical attribute comparisons. While traditional `Bubble Sort` compares elements using a single attribute, this version first evaluates the primary attribute (e.g., `country`), then sequentially checks secondary attributes (`name` → `phone_number` → `job` → `email`) to resolve ties - effectively implementing lexicographical ordering. Each comparison may require up to six attribute checks (primary + five tie-breakers), increasing computational overhead from `O(n²)` to `O(kn²)` where k represents attribute tiers.

### Quick Sort

```python
def sort_persons_quicksort_multilevel(
   persons: List[Person], attribute: str
) -> List[Person]:
   """Optimized multi-level quicksort with early comparison shortcut"""
   if len(persons) <= 1:
       return persons


   # Define tie-breakers and precompute getters
   tie_breakers = ["name", "country", "phone_number", "job", "email"]
   # combines primary sorting attribute with tie_breakers into list
   keys = [attribute] + tie_breakers
   # create list of getter functions for each attribute in keys list
   getters = [attrgetter(key) for key in keys]
  
   # Initialize stack
   stack = [(0, len(persons) - 1)]
  
   # Process ranges iteratively until empty
   while stack:
       # Get current range to process
       low, high = stack.pop()
       # skip of range is invalid or sorted
       if low >= high:
           continue
      
       # Median-of-three pivot selection
       mid = (low + high) // 2 # Calculate middle index of current range


       # Compare element with first
       # If the last element is smaller swap to ensure the first element is smaller
       if getters[0](persons[high]) < getters[0](persons[low]):
           persons[low], persons[high] = persons[high], persons[low]


       # Compare with middle element with the first element
       # if middle element smaller swap them
       if getters[0](persons[mid]) < getters[0](persons[low]):
           persons[mid], persons[low] = persons[low], persons[mid]
      
       # Compare the last element with the middle element
       # if last element smaller swap to ensure middle element is smaller
       if getters[0](persons[high]) < getters[0](persons[mid]):
           persons[high], persons[mid] = persons[mid], persons[high]
      
       # Select pivot element
       pivot = persons[mid]
       pivot_vals = [getter(pivot) for getter in getters]
      
       # initialize pointers for partitioning
       i, j = low, high
      
       # Partition the range while two pointers have not crossed
       while i <= j:


           # Left scan: Move 'i' right
           while True:
               # Get primary attribute at index 'i'
               left_primary = getters[0](persons[i])
               # exit early if
               if left_primary != pivot_vals[0]:
                   if left_primary >= pivot_vals[0]:
                       break
                   # otherwise move pointer right
                   i += 1
                   continue
              
               left_vals = [left_primary] + [getter(persons[i]) for getter in getters[1:]]
               if left_vals >= pivot_vals:
                   break
               i += 1
          
           # Right scan with early exit
           while True:
               # Get primary attribute from index 'j'
               right_primary = getters[0](persons[j])
               # If primary value is not equal to pivots
               # Current value is <= pivots primary value
               # Stop scanning otherwise continue
               if right_primary != pivot_vals[0]:
                   if right_primary <= pivot_vals[0]:
                       break
                   j -= 1
                   continue
              
               # if primary value matches pivot - tiebreak
               # Stop scanning if element <= pivot
               right_vals = [right_primary] + [getter(persons[j]) for getter in getters[1:]]
               if right_vals <= pivot_vals:
                   break
               j -= 1
          
           # Swap elements if pointers haven't crossed
           # Ensures elements in the correct position
           if i <= j:
               persons[i], persons[j] = persons[j], persons[i]
               i += 1 # Move left pointer right
               j -= 1 # Move right pointer left
      
       # Push smaller partition first
       if (j - low) < (high - i):
           stack.append((low, j))
           stack.append((i, high))
       else:
           stack.append((i, high))
           stack.append((low, j))
  
   return persons
   ```
      
The `quicksort_multilevel` algorithm is an enhancement of the classic QuickSort algorithm. With this implementation, we can hierarchically compare attributes. We can have our primary attribute (e.g., `country`) and then sequentially check the secondary attributes (`name` → `job` → `email` → `phone_number`) to resolve duplicate entries.


This is achieved through an iterative approach with a stack that manages sub-ranges (low, high). This algorithm also uses a median-of-three pivot selection, which allows for more evenly sized partitions and improved efficiency by making the pivot closer to the median value. During partitioning, two pointers (i and j) are used to scan the range.


For this particular dataset, there may be up to five attribute checks (primary + 4 tie-breakers). The Big O notation for this would usually be `O(n log n)`, but due to the additional attribute comparisons, it is `O(k n log n)`, where k is the number of attribute tiers.

### Tim Sort

```py
@timer("Time to Sort Person Data Using Timsort with Multi-Level Sorting (ms)")
def sort_persons_timsort_multilevel(
    persons: List[Person], attribute: str
) -> List[Person]:
    """Sort a list of Person objects using Timsort with multi-level comparison"""
    # Define the tie-breaking attributes (e.g., secondary and tertiary attributes)
    tie_breaking_attributes = ["name", "country", "phone_number", "job", "email"]

    # Create a composite key function for multi-level sorting
    def composite_key(person: Person):
        primary_value = getattr(person, attribute)
        tie_values = tuple(getattr(person, tie_attr) for tie_attr in tie_breaking_attributes)
        return (primary_value, *tie_values)

    # Use Timsort (Python's built-in sorted function) with the composite key
    sorted_persons = sorted(persons, key=composite_key)
    return sorted_persons
```

The `sort_persons_timsort_multilevel` function compares the list with multiple attributes if two entries share similar attrbutes. The function first makes a list of the tie breaking attributes. It enters them into a composite key function to form a tuple of the attributes. The tuple holds the primary sorting attribute, the one input when running the algorithm via terminal command, followed by the other attributes. It then uses python's built in `sorted` with the tuple key to sort the file.

# Results

Our results show clear variation in runtime performance when using the different multilevel and non-multilevel sorting algorithms. Overall, the non-multilevel algorithms performed faster than the multilevel algorithms, with an average runtime of 37,546 ms for all non-multilevel algorithms and an average runtime of 66,570 ms for all multilevel algorithms. Non-multilevel Timsort was the fastest algorithm overall, with an average runtime of 10 ms, while multilevel Bubblesort was the slowest algorithm overall, with an average runtime of 285,117 ms. 

The number of identical attributes within each line affected the runtime performance for multilevel algorithms but not for non-multilevel algorithms. For files with lines containing only one identical attribute, the average runtime was 110,536 ms for all multilevel algorithms . For two identical attributes, the average runtime for all multilevel algorithms was 112,437 ms. For all identical attributes, the average runtime for all multilevel algorithms was 146,014 ms. However, for all non-multilevel algorithms, the average runtime was 36,525 ms for one identical attribute, 36,267 ms for two identical attributes, and 36,976 for all identical attributes. This shows that runtime increases for multilevel algorithms but not for non-multilevel algorithms in relation to the number of identical attributes. 

Another factor impacting the runtime performance of the different sorting algorithms is the percentage of lines containing identical attributes. For all multilevel sorting algorithms, the average time for files with 25% of lines containing identical attributes was 88,643 ms, for 50% was 109,786 ms, and for 100% was 170,449 ms. The average for all non-multilevel sorting algorithms was 45,896 ms for 25%, 36,823 ms for 50%, and 26941 ms for 100%. This shows that, for increasing percentages of lines with identical attributes, the multilevel sorting algorithms have a slower runtime while the non-multilevel sorting algorithms have a faster runtime.

Our results and data provide signifigant evidence that Tim Sort is the optimal choice in regards to sorting with configurable attribute prioritization. Using real-world scenarios such as a list of strings with human data, we show how these varying sorting paradigms vary with multilevel data as well as different CPUs. Our results heavily concure that the Tim Sort algorithm consistently outperforms Quicksort and completely outclasses the Bubble Sort. Especially within the best case time complexity. Using these algorithms we also evaluate how windows and its differences in handling recursion can slow the sorting process especially in multilevel sorting. So while Quick Sort could be a viable option for smaller list, you have to expect some trade offs when using certain cpus. Tim sort has shown significant prospects in its ability to manage large list and multilevel sorting, so much so that it is the best bet for fast and optimal sorting processes. 

# Future work

While our multi-level sorting implementation provides robust tie-breaking capabilities, several key enhancements could improve both usability and performance:

## 1. Dynamic Tie-Breaker Specification 

**Current Limitation**:
Tie-breaking attributes follow a fixed priority order (`name → country → phone_number → job → email`), regardless of dataset characteristics.

**Proposed Improvement**:
Allowing user-defined secondary attributes would enable dynamic prioritization—instead of a fixed tie-breaker order, users could specify which attribute to use as the "second most important" when primary duplicates occur. This would reduce unnecessary comparisons for datasets where certain attributes (e.g., `email` vs. `phone_number`) are more likely to resolve ties quickly.

## 2. Adaptive Comparision Depth 

**Proposed Improvements**: We could halt attribute checks once a tie is definitively resolved, avoiding redundant evaluations of lower-priority fields. We could automatically try to implement an algorithm which switch between Bubble Sort (for small datasets) and Timsort (for larger ones), leveraging Bubble Sort’s simplicity for n < 1,000 while retaining Timsort’s scalability.

## 3. Cost-Aware Attribute Ordering 

**Proposed Improvements**: We could also optimize performance by prioritizing attributes with faster comparison operations (e.g., numeric phone_number over string-based job), potentially cutting comparison time.
