# Introduction

Data structures play a critical role in efficient software development, influencing performance, scalability, and system responsiveness. Among them, queues are fundamental, powering applications such as task scheduling, messaging systems, and real-time data processing. In this project, our team explored three key queue implementations—Singly Linked List (SLL), Doubly Linked List (DLL), and Array-based Queue. This project seeks to answer our research question: What are the performance differences between SLL queue, DLL queue, and array-based queue implementations when executing basic operations (addfirst, addlast, removefirst, removelast, add (+), and iadd (+=)?. We analyzed their performance through benchmarking experiments using SystemSense.

As algorithm engineers tackling this project we considered multiple aspects, including:

Algorithmic Complexity: Understanding the time and space complexity of queue operations to determine trade-offs between different implementations.

Memory Management: Evaluating how memory allocation and deallocation affect performance, particularly in linked list-based vs. array-based implementations.

Concurrency Considerations: Investigating how these data structures behave in multi-threaded environments where multiple processes access and modify queues simultaneously.

Use Case Optimization: Identifying practical applications where each queue implementation excels, such as high-throughput systems, real-time event processing, and low-latency applications.

Benchmarking Methodology: Designing experiments to measure execution times, analyze scaling behavior, and compare performance under different workloads.

Through this project, we aim to provide insights into the efficiency of these queue implementations and guide the selection of an optimal data structure based on application requirements. By profiling and analyzing queue operations, we not only enhance our understanding of core data structures but also develop practical skills in performance analysis, a crucial skill in algorithm engineering and systems design.

## Motivation

Efficient data structures are essential in software development, especially when dealing with queues in real-world applications such as scheduling systems, task management, and networking. Different queue implementations like Singly Linked List (SLL), Doubly Linked List (DLL), and Array-based Queue offer trade-offs in terms of performance. Our project aims to benchmark these tradeoffs and analyze the data by comparing the execution times of the queue operations.

# Queue Implementations Analysis

## Queue Structure and FIFO Principle

Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, ensuring sequential processing order.

## Implementations Overview

This project explores three queue implementations:

1. **Singly Linked List (SLL) Queue**
   - Uses one-directional nodes with `next` references
   - Maintains both head and tail pointers for efficient operations
   - Each node stores only the value and next reference

2. **Doubly Linked List (DLL) Queue**
   - Uses bidirectional nodes with both `prev` and `next` references
   - Maintains both head and tail pointers
   - Each node stores value, previous, and next references

3. **Array-based Queue**
   - No explicit node structure, just a container of elements
   - Optimized for operations at both ends

## Key Operations

All implementations support these core operations:
- `enqueue`: Add element to the rear (O(1) in all implementations)
- `dequeue`: Remove element from the front (O(1) in all implementations)
- `peek`: View front element without removing (O(1) in all implementations)
- `__add__`: Concatenate queues (O(1) in linked lists, O(n) in array-based)
- `__iadd__`: In-place concatenation (O(1) in linked lists, O(n) in array-based)

### Key Implementation Examples

#### Enqueue Operation (SLL)

```python
def enqueue(self, value: Any) -> None:
    """Add an element to the end of the queue. O(1) operation using tail pointer."""
    new_node = Node(value)
    if self.is_empty():
        self.head = new_node
    else:
        self.tail.next = new_node  # Directly append at tail
    self.tail = new_node  # Update tail pointer
    self.size += 1
```

#### Dequeue Operation (DLL)

```python
def dequeue(self) -> Any:
    """Remove and return the first element from the queue. O(1) operation."""
    if self.is_empty():
        raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
    value = self.head.value
    self.head = self.head.next
    if self.head is None:
        self.tail = None
    else:
        self.head.prev = None
    self.size -= 1
    return value
```

#### Queue Concatenation (Array-based)

```python
def __add__(self, other: "ListQueueDisplay") -> "ListQueueDisplay":
    """Concatenate two queues. O(n) operation."""
    result = ListQueueDisplay()
    result.items = deque(self.items)  # Copy first queue
    result.items.extend(other.items)  # Append second queue
    return result
```

## Implementation Considerations

### SLL Queue Considerations
- Simpler structure with less memory overhead per node
- Forward-only traversal limits some operations
- Uses tail pointer for O(1) enqueue operations
- Efficient concatenation due to tail pointer

### DLL Queue Considerations
- Bidirectional links enable more flexible operations
- Higher memory usage due to extra pointer per node
- All operations including concatenation are O(1)
- Supports easy traversal in both directions

### Array-based Queue Considerations
- No manual pointer management needed
- Leverages efficient implementation of Python's `deque`
- Basic operations are O(1), but concatenation is O(n)
- Internal array may require occasional reallocation

### Benchmarking

There are two main benchmarking function in our project.

#### Basic analysis

```python
def analyze_queue(queue_class, size=1000):
    """Analyze a queue implementation."""
    approach = next(
        (k for k, v in QUEUE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.items() if v == queue_class), None
    )
    if approach is None:
        console.print("[red]Unknown queue implementation[/red]")
        return

    console.print(f"\n{approach.value.upper()} Queue Implementation")

    try:
        queue = queue_class()
        operations = []

        # Test enqueue
        enqueue_time = time_operation(lambda: [queue.enqueue(i) for i in range(size)])
        operations.append(("enqueue", enqueue_time, size))

        # Test dequeue
        dequeue_count = size // 2
        dequeue_time = time_operation(
            lambda: [queue.dequeue() for _ in range(dequeue_count)]
        )
        operations.append(("dequeue", dequeue_time, dequeue_count))

        # Refill queue
        for i in range(dequeue_count):
            queue.enqueue(i)

        # Test peek
        peek_count = size // 3
        peek_time = time_operation(lambda: [queue.peek() for _ in range(peek_count)])
        operations.append(("peek", peek_time, peek_count))

        # Test concat
        other = queue_class()
        for i in range(size // 10):
            other.enqueue(i)
        concat_time = time_operation(lambda: queue + other)
        operations.append(("concat", concat_time, size // 10))

        # Test iconcat
        iconcat_time = time_operation(lambda: queue.__iadd__(other))
        operations.append(("iconcat", iconcat_time, size // 10))

        # Display results in table
        table = Table(
            title=f"{approach.value.upper()} Queue Performance Analysis",
            box=box.ROUNDED,
            show_header=True,
            header_style="bold magenta",
        )
        table.add_column("Operation", style="cyan")
        table.add_column("Time (ms)", justify="right")
        table.add_column("Elements", justify="right")
        table.add_column("Time/Element (ms)", justify="right")

        for operation, time_taken, elements in operations:
            time_per_element = time_taken / elements if elements > 0 else 0
            table.add_row(
                operation,
                f"{time_taken * 1000:.6f}",  # Convert to milliseconds
                f"{elements:,}",
                f"{time_per_element * 1000:.6f}",  # Convert to milliseconds
            )

        console.print(Panel(table))

    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"[red]Error testing {approach.value}: {str(e)}[/red]")
        import traceback

        console.print(traceback.format_exc())
```

This function performs a basic performance analysis with the following operations:
- Enqueue: Adds size elements to the queue
- Dequeue: Removes size/2 elements
- Peek: Looks at size/3 elements without removing them
- Concat: Concatenates with another queue of size size/10
- Iconcat: In-place concatenation with another queue of size size/10

This doubling experiment does the following
- Starts with initial_size and doubles the size until reaching max_size
- For each size, measures the same operations as the basic analysis
- Generates plots to visualize the results

#### Key benchmarking feature

##### Timing Mechanism

```python

def time_operation(func):
    """Time an operation using high-precision counter."""
    try:
        # Warm up
        func()

        # Actual timing
        start_time = perf_counter()
        func()
        elapsed = perf_counter() - start_time
        return elapsed
    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"[red]Error during operation: {str(e)}[/red]")
        return float("nan")
```

- Uses perf_counter() for high-precision timing
- Includes a warm-up run to avoid cold-start penalties
- Returns elapsed time in seconds

##### Result Visualization

```python
def plot_results(sizes, all_results, results_dir):
    """Generate and save plots for doubling experiment results."""
    operations = ["enqueue", "dequeue", "peek", "concat", "iconcat"]

    # Create log-log plots for each operation (keeping only these, removing regular operation plots)
    for operation in operations:
        # Skip regular plots for operations - only create log-log plots
        if len(sizes) > 2:  # Only create log plots if we have enough data points

    # Create regular performance plots for each implementation (keeping these, removing log-scale implementation plots)
    for impl, results in all_results.items():
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

        for operation in operations:
            times = np.array(results[operation]) * 1000  # Convert to milliseconds
            plt.plot(sizes, times, marker="o", label=operation, linewidth=2)

        plt.legend(fontsize=12)
        plt.tight_layout()

        # Save plot
        plot_path = results_dir / f"{impl}_performance.png"
        plt.savefig(plot_path)
        plt.close()
```

#### Run of Performance Analysis

I am going to talk about the performance analysis of the three queue implementations: SLL, DLL, and Array when running operations like removeFirst, removeLast, addFirst, addLast, peek, dequeue, enqueue, and concat.

First, I want to explain the performance analysis of the SLL queue implementation. The SLL stores a list of elements and accesses the elements in a linear way, so the time complexity of the SLL queue implementation is O(n) for most operations. The SLL has one exception: thanks to its head pointer, the addFirst operation is O(1). For example, in the doubling experiment, the addFirst operation for the SLL took only 0.0065 ms for 1 element, while addLast took 1.0246 ms for 1,000 elements because it requires traversing the list.

The DLL queue implementation stores a list of elements as well, but it accesses the elements in a bidirectional way. This means the time complexity of the DLL for operations with the first and last items, such as addFirst and addLast, is O(1) due to the head and tail pointers. For instance, in the doubling experiment, the addLast operation for the DLL took 0.00353 ms for 100 elements and remained efficient even as the input size increased, taking only 0.0051 ms for 6,400 elements.

What is a head and tail pointer?

These are pointers that reference the first and last elements of the linked list. When removing or adding elements at these positions, the list does not need to shift its elements. Instead, the pointers are updated to reference the next or previous node. In the SLL, there is only a head pointer, while in the DLL, there are both head and tail pointers.

The Array-based Queue implementation uses a list of elements where the time complexity for accessing the first and last elements is O(1). However, adding or removing elements is only O(1) if the operation is at the end of the list. If the operation is at the beginning or in the middle, it becomes O(n) because all the elements need to shift to make space or fill the gap. For example, in the doubling experiment, the addFirst operation for the Array-based Queue took 0.00208 ms for 100 elements but increased to 0.00444 ms for 6,400 elements due to the shifting required.
