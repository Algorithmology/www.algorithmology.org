## Introduction

During our team's exploration of sorting algorithms and their performance
characteristics, an interesting research question emerged: How can we
effectively sort test cases considering multiple factors simultaneously?
Traditional sorting algorithms excel at sorting based on a single criterion, but
real-world test case prioritization often requires balancing multiple
objectives, such as execution time and code coverage.

This research question led us to investigate the potential of multi-objective
optimization algorithms, specifically NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm II), in comparison to traditional sorting approaches. While
traditional algorithms like Quick Sort and Bubble Sort can sort test cases based
on one factor at a time, NSGA-II offers the advantage of considering multiple
objectives simultaneously, potentially providing more nuanced and practical test
case prioritization.

Our research aims to answer the question: How does NSGA-II compare to
traditional sorting algorithms in terms of running time when comparing test
cases in terms of execution speed and code coverage factors? The traditional
algorithms would sort according to one factor at a time while NSGA-II would sort
according to both factors.

### Data Collection and Gathering

For our research, we selected the Chasten project, a publicly available GitHub
repository developed as part of a course in our department. This choice was
strategic for several reasons:

1. **Reproducibility**: Since Chasten was developed within our department, we
   have direct access to its development history and can ensure that others can
replicate our study.

2. **Test Infrastructure**: The project includes a comprehensive test suite,
   making it an ideal candidate for analyzing test case execution times and
coverage metrics.

3. **Tool Development**: As a tool developed in an academic setting, Chasten
   provides a controlled environment for our research, with well-defined test
cases and clear execution patterns.

To collect our data, we developed a custom script (`collect_test_metrics.py`)
that leverages `pytest-cov`, a pytest plugin for measuring code coverage. The
script executes the test suite using Poetry's task runner with specific
`pytest-cov` configurations to generate detailed coverage reports. The coverage
data is collected using the following command structure:

```bash
pytest --cov=chasten tests/ --cov-report=json
```

This command generates a `coverage.json` file that contains detailed coverage information for each module in the project. The
JSON structure includes:
- Executed lines for each file
- Summary statistics including covered lines, total statements, and coverage percentages
- Missing and excluded lines
- Context information for each covered line

The coverage.json file is structured hierarchically, with each module's data organized under the "files" key. For example:
```json
{
    "files": {
        "chasten/checks.py": {
            "executed_lines": [...],
            "summary": {
                "covered_lines": 50,
                "num_statements": 51,
                "percent_covered": 98,
                "missing_lines": 1,
                "excluded_lines": 0
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To prepare this data for analysis, we developed a mapping script (`mapper.py`) that serves two key purposes:

1. **Traditional Analysis Format**: The script reads both the coverage.json and test_metrics.json files, creating a mapping
between test cases and their corresponding module coverage data. It computes a ratio of covered lines to test duration for each
test case, which helps identify tests that provide the best coverage per unit of time.

2. **NSGA-II Format**: The script also transforms the data into a specialized format required by the NSGA-II algorithm. Each
test case is represented as a list of `[test name, duration, coverage]`, where coverage is the raw number of covered lines from
the coverage.json file. This format enables multi-objective optimization, allowing us to simultaneously consider both test
execution time and code coverage.

The mapping process ensures proper handling of edge cases:
- Failed or skipped tests are assigned zero coverage values
- Tests with zero duration are handled gracefully
- Each test case is correctly associated with its corresponding module's coverage data
- The data is structured appropriately for both traditional and multi-objective analysis approaches

This data preparation pipeline enables us to:
- Compare the effectiveness of different test prioritization approaches
- Analyze the trade-offs between test execution time and coverage
- Generate reproducible results for both traditional and NSGA-II algorithms
- Maintain data consistency across different analysis methods

## Implementation

The implementation of this project required the use of several algorithms. As we
were comparing traditional algorithms with multi objective algorithms. We
decided upon two different traditional algorithms, quick sort and bubble sort.
As for the multi objective algorithms, we had the NSGA-II sorting algorithm
recommended to us by Professor Kapfhammer, so we decided to look into that one.
More specifics about each algorithm are below.

### The Quick Sort Algorithm

We selected the Quick Sort algorithm for this experiment due to its efficiency
in handling large datasets. With an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`,
Quick Sort is faster than simpler algorithms like Bubble Sort, making it ideal
for optimizing test prioritization. The algorithm selects a random pivot to
avoid worst-case performance of `O(n²)` and recursively sorts the elements less
than and greater than the pivot.

In this implementation, Quick Sort organizes the test cases based on the
coverage/time ratio. The data is partitioned around the pivot, with elements
smaller than the pivot in the left partition and those greater in the right. The
function recursively sorts both partitions, and once sorted, the pivot is placed
between them to produce the final sorted list. This ensures that the most
efficient tests (lowest coverage/time ratio) are prioritized.

```python
import json # Import the JSON module to handle JSON file operations
import time # Import the time module to measure execution time
import random  # Import random for selecting a random pivot in QuickSort
from typing import List, Dict, Any


def quicksort(arr: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """Sorts an array using the QuickSort algorithm with a random pivot."""
    if len(arr) <= 1: # Base case if the array has 1 or no elements, it's already sorted
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = random.choice(arr)  # Select a random pivot element from the array
        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements less than the pivot
        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than the pivot
        # Recursively sort the left and right partitions and combine them with the pivot
        return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)
```

This approach minimizes the risk of worst-case performance and ensures the most
efficient tests are prioritized, optimizing the testing process by focusing on
the best results with the least amount of time.

### The Bucket Sort Algorithm

We selected the Bucket Sort algorithm for this experiment due to its efficiency
in distributing and sorting data across multiple buckets. With an average time
complexity of O(n + k), Bucket Sort is well-suited for handling large datasets,
especially when the input is uniformly distributed. Unlike comparison-based
algorithms like Quick Sort, it efficiently categorizes elements into buckets and
sorts them individually, reducing the overall sorting overhead.  

In this implementation, Bucket Sort organizes test cases based on the
coverage/time ratio. The algorithm first distributes the test cases into buckets
according to their values, ensuring that similar elements are grouped together.
Each bucket is then sorted individually using an appropriate sorting method,
such as Insertion Sort, before being concatenated to form the final sorted list.
This process ensures that test cases with the lowest coverage/time ratio are
prioritized, optimizing test execution order.

```python
import json
import os
from typing import List, Dict, Any

# Function to perform bucket sort on test cases based on a given attribute
def bucket_sort(data: List[Dict[str, Any]], attribute: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Sort a list of dictionaries using bucket sort based on a given attribute."""
    max_value = max(item[attribute] for item in data)  # Find the maximum value of the attribute
    buckets = [[] for _ in range(int(max_value) + 1)]  # Create buckets

    for item in data:  # Place each item in the appropriate bucket
        buckets[int(item[attribute])].append(item)

    sorted_data = []  # Concatenate all buckets into a sorted list
    for bucket in buckets:
        sorted_data.extend(bucket)

    return sorted_data  # Return the sorted list

# Function to load data from a JSON file
def load_data(file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Load data from a JSON file."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):  # Check if the file exists
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {file_path}")
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    return data  # Return the loaded data

# Function to find the test case with the highest coverage
def find_highest_coverage_test_case(sorted_tests: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Finds the test case with the highest coverage."""
    highest_coverage_test: Dict[str, Any] = sorted_tests[0]  # Start with the first test case
    for test in sorted_tests:  # Loop through all test cases
        if test['coverage'] > highest_coverage_test['coverage']:
            highest_coverage_test = test  # Update the test case with the highest coverage
    return highest_coverage_test  # Return the test case with the largest coverage

# Main function to execute the script
def main():
    file_path = 'data/newtryingToCompute.json'  # Path to your test metrics file

    # Debugging: Print the absolute path being used
    print(f"Looking for file at: {os.path.abspath(file_path)}")

    try:
        data = load_data(file_path)  # Load the test metrics data
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(e)
        return

    sorted_tests_by_coverage: List[Dict[str, Any]] = bucket_sort(data, 'coverage')  # Sort by coverage
    highest_coverage_test_case: Dict[str, Any] = find_highest_coverage_test_case(sorted_tests_by_coverage)  # Find the highest coverage

    # Print the results
    print("\n🌟 Results 🌟")
    print("\n🚀 Test Case with Highest Coverage:")
    print(f"Test Name: {highest_coverage_test_case['name']}")
    print(f"Coverage: {highest_coverage_test_case['coverage']}")

# Entry point of the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This approach reduces the likelihood of uneven data distribution, ensuring
efficient sorting and prioritization of test cases. By grouping similar values
into buckets and sorting them individually, the testing process is optimized,
focusing on the most effective test cases with minimal execution time.

### The NSGA-II Multi Objective Algorithm

The NSGA-II multi objective sorting algorithm is broken down into a variety of
approaches. We utilized the binary tournament approach and slightly adapted it
to suite our needs. The file that runs this part of the experiment has two main
parts, the `binary_tournament` function and `main`.

The `binary_tournament` function runs the bulk of the experiment, utilizing a
list of indices that indicate the opponents for each tournament to be performed,
`P`, and the population object storing all the objects to be pitted against each
other in tournaments, `pop`. From there, the tournaments are run continuously
until all of them have been completed. In the implementation, the function also
collects and constantly updates the list of names dictating the winners with a
list also dictated for the losers to help update the list of winners. At the
end, the final winner's list is printed. It is worth noting that there are
slightly different outcomes each time. This could be due to slightly different
evaluations occurring each time as there are several aspects that go into
running the algorithm, even with a limited number of factors to consider. It is
also worth noting that the variable `S` refers to the result returned by the
function, a list of the memory locations for all the winners. As that is not as
helpful to our purposes, it is not seen in our results.

``` python
for i in range(n_tournaments):
        a, b = P[i]

        # if the first individual is better, choose it
        if pop[a].F < pop[b].F:
            S[i] = a
            loser = pop[b].name
            winner = pop[a].name
        # otherwise take the other individual
        else:
            S[i] = b
            loser = pop[a].name
            winner = pop[b].name
   
        # update lists with name records
        if winner not in winner_list:
            if winner not in loser_list:
                winner_list.append(winner)
            else:
                winner_list.remove(loser)
        if loser not in loser_list:
            loser_list.append(loser)

    # return the names of the ideal tests
    print(f"The Ideal Tests Are: {winner_list}")
    return S
```

Main, on the other hand, looks into generating the list of competitor indices
using the nested for loop method as that allowed the result to be made as a list
of lists instead of a list of tuples which is not the right format for the
`binary_tournament` function. Also, main generates the Population object. First,
a 2d numpy array is created from the JSON file designated for use by the NSGA-II
algorithm as the formatting is slightly different to accommodate the
`binary_tournament` function. Then, a list of Individual objects is created from
the information in the array. Finally, that list is passed into a brand new
Population object. Finally, main runs the tournaments by calling the
`binary_tournament` function with the Population object and array of competitor
index pairs passed in.

The results produced from this algorithm are the best test cases according to a
fitness factor, `F` which is calculated similarly to the values used for the two
more traditional sorting algorithms, dividing the duration of the test case by
the number of lines it covers and comparing those values in each tournament.

## The Results

In this experiment, we focused on comparing the runtime performance of three
algorithms—NSGA-II, QuickSort, and Bucket Sort—by measuring their runtime with a
single factor in mind: coverage. We conducted tests on a single dataset and
recorded the time taken by each algorithm to complete the task.

The results from the experiment are summarized in the following table:

| Dataset Size |     NSGA2 (ms)   | QuickSort (ms) | Bucket Sort (ms) |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 92 lines     |       7.38       |     0.3        |      0.13        |

- Observations:

NSGA-II had the highest runtime, which is expected given its complexity and the
nature of multi-objective optimization tasks. Its process of evolving solutions
requires significant computational overhead, making it less efficient for simple
tasks like sorting or coverage evaluation. However, one benefit of the algorithm
is that it prioritizes the best tests to run by considering multiple factors at
once. So, it is optimal for solving problems where the most optimal solution in
accordance with multiple factors is needed. Also, the results from this
algorithm are often more than one test case, so the user is given a list of a
few optimal test cases to run instead of just one test case.

QuickSort, a well-known sorting algorithm, performed significantly faster than
NSGA-II, reflecting its efficiency in handling ordered data. With its average
time complexity of O(N log N), QuickSort proved well-suited for the task, even
as the dataset size was relatively small. This algorithm produces the top test
case according to a ratio of duration divided by the number of lines covered.
Seeing as that ratio is all that is used to sort the test cases, the results may
differ from those produced by NSGA-II. This algorithm is effective for simple
sorting tasks like when it was given the ratio mentioned above.

Bucket Sort, with its near-linear time complexity under optimal conditions,
demonstrated the fastest performance in this experiment, significantly
outperforming both NSGA-II and QuickSort on the given dataset. This algorithm
produces the top test case according to a ratio of duration divided by the
number of lines covered. Like with quick sort, since that ratio is all that is
used to sort the test cases, the algorithm's results may differ from those
produced by NSGA-II. This algorithm is effective for simple sorting tasks like
when it was given the ratio mentioned above. Plus, it does not use recursion
like quick sort, making it the fastest sorting algorithm in our experiment.

## Conclusion

The results of this experiment indicate that, under the tested scenario, NSGA-II
did not outperform the algorithms we compared it to (QuickSort and Bucket Sort).
Given that these algorithms are designed for fundamentally different purposes,
the performance discrepancy is expected. Our tests were conducted in a context
that favored QuickSort and Bucket Sort, which is inherently more efficient for
the sorting tasks at hand. Consequently, while NSGA-II excels in multi-objective
optimization, it is not suited for tasks where traditional sorting algorithms
like QuickSort are more appropriate.
