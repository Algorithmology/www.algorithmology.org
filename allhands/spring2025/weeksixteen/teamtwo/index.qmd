# Introduction

This study examines how `linear search`, `binary search`, and `balanced binary search tree (BST)` algorithms perform under varying conditions, specifically looking at:

1. How dataset size affects performance scaling
2. How target element position impacts search efficiency

# Motivation

While `linear search` `(O(n))` offers simplicity and `binary search`/`balanced BSTs` `(O(log n))` promise theoretical efficiency, real-world performance depends heavily on:

1. Dataset growth patterns

2. Target location distributions

3. Hardware/platform characteristics

Our benchmarking provides empirical insights to guide algorithm selection in production systems where theoretical models may not reflect actual behavior.

# Method

For this experiment, we developed a benchmarking tool that allows for systematic comparison between search algorithms across different data structures. The tool measures execution time while controlling for:

1. Data structure type (`unsorted list`, `sorted list` and `binary search tree`)
2. Search algorithm (`linear search` vs. `binary search` vs. `BST search`)
3. Dataset size (with automatic doubling between runs)
4. Target position (`beginning`, `middle`, `end`, `random`, or `nonexistent`)

# Approach

## Linear Search

```cmd
def linear_search(dataset: List[Any], target: Any) -> Optional[int]:
    """Perform a linear search on the dataset.

    Args:
        dataset: List to search through
        target: Element to search for

    Returns:
        int: Index of the target element, or None if not found
    """
    # Iterate through the dataset
    for i, item in enumerate(dataset):
        if item == target:
            return i

    # Target not found
    return None
```

Linear search sequentially checks each element until finding the target or reaching the end. It works on both sorted and unsorted data with `O(n)` time complexity.

## Binary Search

TODO

## Binary Search Tree

```cmd
class Node:
    """Creates the Node class for the BST."""

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.l_child = None
        self.r_child = None
        self.data = value


class BinarySearchTree:
    """Initializing the BST."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, value):
        """Inserts the value into the tree."""
        if self.root is None:
            self.root = Node(value)
        else:
            self.insert_recursive(self.root, value)

    def insert_recursive(self, node, value):
        """Inserts the value into the tree recursively."""
        if value < node.data:
            if node.l_child is None:
                node.l_child = Node(value)
            else:
                self.insert_recursive(node.l_child, value)
        else:  # noqa: PLR5501
            if node.r_child is None:
                node.r_child = Node(value)
            else:
                self.insert_recursive(node.r_child, value)

    def search(self, target):
        """Search for a value in the BST and return if found."""
        return self.search_recursive(self.root, target)

    def search_recursive(self, node, target):
        """Search for a value in the BST recursively."""
        if node is None:
            return False
        if node.data == target:
            return True
        elif target < node.data:
            return self.search_recursive(node.l_child, target)
        else:
            return self.search_recursive(node.r_child, target)
```

The Binary Search Tree, is such an efficient approach for searching projects, with a balanced BST the time complexity is O(logn). The logic behind the BST is that the function, starts with a root node (starting node) and from there comparing the inputs to the target value, the smaller values go to the left as a child and the bigger values go to the right as a child. The BST uses recursion when adding the "children" therefore, the data is always sorted and balanced as it is being implemented to the tree. When searching for a target value, it constantly compares the current node's value and the target value to get to the target. Here is what a balanced BST looks like: 

        10
       /  \
      5    15
     / \   / \
    3   7 12 18
the smaller numbers go to the left, and the bigger numbers go to the right. It is very efficient because you do not necessarily go through the majority of the values, depending on the value.

# Data

We conducted experiments with datasets of `1,000` and `5,000` elements, using both sorted and unsorted arrays. For each algorithm, we measured:

1. Performance across different dataset sizes
2. Impact of target position (`beginning`, `middle`, `end`, or `nonexistent`)
3. Runtime consistency across multiple searches (`100` and `500` searches)

# Conclusion

# TODO

# Future Work

Several areas for future investigation could provide additional insights:

- **Floating-point comparison overhead might affect the relative performance advantages**
    - Decimal comparisons introduce additional computational overhead and potential precision issues that could affect performance differently across algorithms. This would be particularly relevant for scientific computing and financial applications where decimal data is common.
