# Overview and Introduction

Introducing Bosco: a versatile benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the performance of
arbitrary list-processing algorithms through doubling experiments. The tool BOSCO stands for, Benchmarking
of Sorting & Computational OperationsBosco automates the process of benchmarking by accepting Python source
code files containing list-processing functions, fully-qualified function names for benchmarking, and input
generation procedures. Leveraging Typer for a user-friendly command-line interface and Poetry for dependency
management, Bosco streamlines the benchmarking process. Key features include automatic extraction and
invocation of list-processing functions, generation of data sets fordoubling experiments, and computation of
doubling ratios to infer worst-case time complexity. Diagnostic data, including execution times for each
experiment round and inferred time complexities, are provided for comprehensive analysis. With Bosco, researchers
and developers can efficiently assess the performance of list-processing algorithms, facilitating informed
decision-making and optimization efforts.
