## Introduction

### Organizing Data

### A Note About Timing

## Implementation and Results

The implementation of this project required the use of serveral algorithms. As we were comparing traditional algorithms with
multi objective algorithms. We decided upon two different traditional algorithms, quick sort and bubble sort. As for the multi
objective algorithms, we had the NSGA-II sorting algorithm recommended to us by Professor Kaphammer, so we decided to look into
that one. More specifics about each algorithm and the results obtained are below. (Insert general note about how the results
compare here, aka which method, multi objective or traditional, was better)

### The Quick Sort Algorithm

### The Bubble Sort Algorithm

### The NSGA-II Multi Objective Algorithm
